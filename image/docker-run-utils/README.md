# Docker Run Utilities

## Description

Contains utilities to run docker containers.

## Usage

Add a git sub-module to the repository that is going to use the utilities.
Since docker can not reference files outside the dockerfile context, the
sub-module must be added to the context directory.

```
git submodule add git@anrisoftware.com:robobeerun/docker-run-utils.git image/docker-run-utils
```
